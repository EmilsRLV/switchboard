# Switchboard (working title)

A small desktop app for Windows and Linux whose main surface is a **graph of projects, Claude Code
sessions and branches**. It starts, watches, connects and reviews Claude Code sessions. It is not a
text editor.

Status: **Epic 1 in progress**. The Tauri 2 shell (Rust core, React 19 + TypeScript + Vite UI) builds
and tests on Windows; no product features yet.

## Plans

| Document | What it holds |
|---|---|
| [`_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/product-brief.md`](_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/product-brief.md) | Problem, vision, goals, non-goals |
| [`_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd.md`](_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd.md) | Numbered requirements (`FR-*`, `NFR-*`), UX principles, open questions |
| [`_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md`](_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md) | Decisions (Tauri 2, terminal-first, in-app MCP, hooks for status), modules, data, launch recipe, risks |
| [`_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`](_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md) | 9 epics / 35 stories with acceptance criteria |
| [`docs/research/claude-code-integration.md`](docs/research/claude-code-integration.md) | What was verified about Claude Code 2.1.301 and what still needs checking |

## Dev loop

Prerequisites: Rust 1.94 (MSVC toolchain on Windows), Node 25, WebView2 (ships with Windows 11).
Linux prerequisites (webkit2gtk 4.1 and friends) are pinned down in Story 1.2 together with CI.

```powershell
npm install              # frontend deps (pinned in package.json)
npm run tauri dev        # opens the "Switchboard" window; Vite on :1420 with HMR, cargo rebuilds on Rust changes
npm test                 # vitest: frontend stores and logic
npm run typecheck        # tsc --noEmit
cd src-tauri; cargo test # Rust modules
```

`npm run tauri build -- --debug --no-bundle` produces `src-tauri/target/debug/switchboard.exe` without
installers; plain `npm run tauri build` also bundles NSIS/MSI (Windows) or AppImage/.deb (Linux).

Layout follows [`architecture.md` §8](_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md): `src/` is the React
app (`ipc/` is the only place Rust is called, `state/` holds Zustand stores, `theme/` the CSS variables),
`src-tauri/` the Rust core (`src/ipc/` holds the thin Tauri commands; other modules arrive with their stories).

Stories are specced one at a time into `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/spec-<epic>-<story>-*.md`
in the same shape as `map-maker`'s specs (Intent / Boundaries / I-O matrix / Code Map / Tasks).
